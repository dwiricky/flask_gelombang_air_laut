# Gelombang Laut Energy Financial Dashboard

This project is a Flask-based web application that calculates and displays the financial feasibility of a wave energy project, using various parameters such as wave height, period, conversion efficiency, and operational costs.

## Features
- Calculates technical parameters like wave power and energy production.
- Computes financial parameters such as NPV (Net Present Value), IRR (Internal Rate of Return), and LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy).
- Visualizes data through various graphs such as cash flow, IRR vs Discount rate, and LCOE vs electricity price.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11
- Flask
- Pandas
- Chart.js (for data visualization)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dwiricky/flask_gelombang_air_laut.git
   cd flask_gelombang_air_laut
